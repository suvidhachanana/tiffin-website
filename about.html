      <h1 class="lobster_font">Story of tiffin</h1>
      <p>tiffin means “food box” and this is exactly what we want you to do. The initiator of tiffin, Suvidha Khanna
Chanana, was inspired by the food her mother used to cook for her as a child. She learned cooking from
her mother and those very recepies are being followed with all precision and delivered to the students and
everyone who wants to enjoy the authentic flavours of Indian households. We also want our customers to
feel the hospitality and warmth of Indian traditional homes. Here we are welcoming you to our kitchen with
folded hands in respect and love. ‘Namaste’ is the word we use to greet people which means "I bow to the
divine in you"</p>
